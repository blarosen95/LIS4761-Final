Data Preparation (Blake Rosenberg):
```{r}
# Set working directory to data folder
setwd('data')
# Load the data
df_raw <- read.csv("SmokeBan.csv", header=TRUE)
# Set working directory back to project root through traversal
# TODO: This could be changed to an `output` folder if desired, but I'm not sure we will need it.
setwd('..')

# Create a dataframe with all columns, renaming X to `PK` (in the event that we need to use a primary key)
df_clean <- df_raw %>% rename(PK=X)
# Clean the dataframe: Cast smoker, ban, education, afam, hispanic, and gender to factor
df_clean$smoker <- as.factor(df_clean$smoker)
df_clean$ban <- as.factor(df_clean$ban)
df_clean$education <- as.factor(df_clean$education)
df_clean$afam <- as.factor(df_clean$afam)
df_clean$hispanic <- as.factor(df_clean$hispanic)
df_clean$gender <- as.factor(df_clean$gender)

# Create subsetted dataframes from df_clean:
# TODO: Remove any subsets that end up going unused
# 1. Dataframe containing only smokers:
df_smokers <- df_clean[df_clean$smoker == 'yes',]
# 2. Dataframe containing only non-smokers:
df_nonsmokers <- df_clean[df_clean$smoker == 'no',]
# 3. Dataframe containing only respondents who's workplaces have an indoor smooking ban in place:
df_banned <- df_clean[df_clean$ban == 'yes',]
# 4. Dataframe containing only respondents who's workplaces have no indoor smooking ban in place:
df_unbanned <- df_clean[df_clean$ban == 'no',]
# 5. Dataframe containing only African American respondents:
df_afam <- df_clean[df_clean$afam == 'yes',]
# 6. Dataframe containing only non-African American respondents:

df_male <- df_clean[df_clean$gender == 'male',]
# 10. Dataframe containing only female respondents:
df_female <- df_clean[df_clean$gender == 'female',]
# 11. Dataframe containing only high school drop outs:

# 12. Dataframe containing only high school graduates:

# 15. Dataframe containing only respondents who have a master's degree:

# Minimum age observed amongst repondents:
min_age <- min(df_clean$age)
# Maximum age observed amongst respondents:
max_age <- max(df_clean$age)

# Subsets of the dataframe for age groups:
# TODO: We can redefine these if desired (currently opting for decades)
# 1. Dataframe containing only respondents who are in their teens:
df_teens <- df_clean[is.element(df_clean$age, min_age:19),]
# 2. Dataframe containing only respondents who are in their twenties:

# 8. Dataframe containing only respondents who are in their eighties:

# Subsets that are simply quarters of the clean dataframe:
cutpoint <- nrow(df_clean)/4
# Note that the parentheses are necessary after the first quarter as colon operator has precedence
df_quarter_1 <- df_clean[1:cutpoint,]
df_quarter_2 <- df_clean[(cutpoint+1):(cutpoint*2),]
df_quarter_3 <- df_clean[(cutpoint*2+1):(cutpoint*3),]

# It seems that Female, college, and yes are the three most important parts of sheet. 
# This shows that females with a college education work where there is a ban on smoking.
