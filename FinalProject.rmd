Data Preparation:
```{r}
# Load the data
df_raw <- read.csv("data/smokeBan.csv", header=TRUE)

# Create a dataframe with all columns, renaming X to `PK` (in the event that we need to use a primary key)
df_clean <- df_raw %>% rename(PK=X)
# Clean the dataframe: Cast smoker, ban, education, afam, hispanic, and gender to factors
df_clean$smoker <- as.factor(df_clean$smoker)
df_clean$ban <- as.factor(df_clean$ban)
df_clean$education <- as.factor(df_clean$education)
df_clean$afam <- as.factor(df_clean$afam)
df_clean$hispanic <- as.factor(df_clean$hispanic)
df_clean$gender <- as.factor(df_clean$gender)

# Create subsetted dataframes from df_clean:
# Smokers vs Non-smokers
df_smokers <- df_clean[df_clean$smoker == 'yes',]
df_nonsmokers <- df_clean[df_clean$smoker == 'no',]
# Respondents whose workforce has an indoor smoking ban vs those that do not
df_banned <- df_clean[df_clean$ban == 'yes',]
df_unbanned <- df_clean[df_clean$ban == 'no',]
# Subset of African Americans and a subset of non-African American respondents
df_afam <- df_clean[df_clean$afam == 'yes',]
df_nonafam <- df_clean[df_clean$afam == 'no',]
df_hispanic <- df_clean[df_clean$hispanic == 'yes',]
df_nonhispanic <- df_clean[df_clean$hispanic == 'no',]
df_male <- df_clean[df_clean$gender == 'male',]
df_female <- df_clean[df_clean$gender == 'female',]
# Subsets of the dataframe based on their indicated level of education
df_dropout <- df_clean[df_clean$education == 'hs drop out',]
df_highschool <- df_clean[df_clean$education == 'hs',]
# Some college could mean either still ongoing or did not finish
df_somecollege <- df_clean[df_clean$education == 'some college',]
df_college <- df_clean[df_clean$education == 'college',]
df_master <- df_clean[df_clean$education == 'master',]

min_age <- min(df_clean$age)
max_age <- max(df_clean$age)

# Subsets of the dataframe for age grouping by decade:
df_teens <- df_clean[is.element(df_clean$age, min_age:19),]
df_twenties <- df_clean[is.element(df_clean$age, 20:29),]
df_thirties <- df_clean[is.element(df_clean$age, 30:39),]

df_seventies <- df_clean[is.element(df_clean$age, 70:79),]
df_eighties <- df_clean[is.element(df_clean$age, 80:max_age),]


# Subsets that are simply quarters of the clean dataframe:
cutpoint <- nrow(df_clean)/4
# Note that the parentheses are necessary after the first quarter as colon operator has precedence
df_quarter_1 <- df_clean[1:cutpoint,]
df_quarter_2 <- df_clean[(cutpoint+1):(cutpoint*2),]
df_quarter_3 <- df_clean[(cutpoint*2+1):(cutpoint*3),]

```

Analysis #1:
```{r}

dfs <- do.call('rbind', lapply(df_clean, as.data.frame))
words.corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(dfs))

words.corpus <- tm_map(words.corpus, content_transformer(tolower))

words.corpus <- tm_map(words.corpus, removeWords, c(stopwords("en"), "can", ""))

words.corpus <- tm_map(words.corpus, removePunctuation)


# Wordcloud part.
tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(words.corpus)
tdm

m <- as.matrix(tdm)
wordCounts <- rowSums(m)
wordCounts <- sort(wordCounts, decreasing=TRUE)

cloudFrame <- data.frame(word = names(wordCounts), freq=wordCounts)

wordcloud(cloudFrame$word, cloudFrame$freq)

wordcloud(names(wordCounts), wordCounts, min.freq=0, max.words=50, rot.per=0.45, 
          colors=brewer.pal(5, "Accent"))

# It seems that Female, college, and yes are the three most important parts of sheet. 
# This shows that females with a college education work where there is a ban on smoking.

```

Analysis #2:
```{r}

# aRules Data Analysis

summary(df_clean)

# convert dataframe into a transactions dataset
df_clean.trans <- as(df_clean, "transactions")

# create rules
ruleset <- apriori(df_clean.trans, parameter = list(support = 0.25, confidence = 0.5))
ruleset
summary(ruleset)

# view the contents of each rule
inspect(ruleset)

# visualization
plot(ruleset)

# choose rules with high lift value
goodrules <- ruleset[quality(ruleset)$lift > 1.1]
inspect(goodrules)

# Conclusion:
# The three rules that are the most interesting and useful (has the highest 
# lift value) show that females that are non-Hispanic and non-African American
# with smoking bans at their jobs are less likely to smoke in the work place
# than any other worker demographic. Rule 1 indicates that female workers  
# generally smoke less than males.
